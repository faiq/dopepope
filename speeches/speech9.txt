If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge him? The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains this very well. It says they should not be marginalized because of this (orientation) but that they must be integrated into society.

The problem is not having this orientation. We must be brothers. The problem is lobbying by this orientation, or lobbies of greedy people, political lobbies, Masonic lobbies, so many lobbies. This is the worse problem.

You see a lot written about the gay lobby. I still have not seen anyone in the Vatican with an identity card saying they are gay.

But with regards to the ordination of women, the Church has spoken and says 'no'. Pope John Paul said so with a formula that was definitive. That door is closed.
